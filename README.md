# Final Project of IEOR4501

## Introduction
We use Python to do some analysis on yellow taxi / uber trips in NYC from 2009 to 2015.\

We first download raw data on yellow taxi trips, uber trips, and weather from the given URLs and do some necessary cleaning. Then we store the cleaned data in a database. We query the data from the database with SQL to have a deep understanding of it. Finally, we do some visualization with the data.
